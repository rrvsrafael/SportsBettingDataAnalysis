# Sports Betting Analysis

Within this repository, you will find a comprehensive collection of code dedicated to the in-depth analysis of data derived from sports betting platforms. The primary objective of this undertaking is to leverage historical data for the purpose of discerning the likelihood of certain betting odds resulting in successful outcomes. Through meticulous examination, we aim to ascertain patterns that reveal odds more inclined towards victory as well as those inclined towards lower likelihoods of success.
